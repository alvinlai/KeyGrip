# Key Grip

These notes help keep me on track while I know what to share before and after pasting each clip.

    Imagine selecting text on your iPad and pasting it on your Mac.

The point is to help weave a story through a live code demo, but with the safety of knowing exactly what code will be pasted in.

    Imagine a script that helps you remember where you were going as you paste in code snippets to tell a story.

It's similar to what Apple did with their app DemoMonkey app, but it uses Bonjour over Wifi for amazingly simple synchronization with the companion iOS app.

    You're imagining KeyGrip.
